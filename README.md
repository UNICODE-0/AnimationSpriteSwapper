# AnimationSpriteSwapper
Tool for quickly replacing sprites in animation

**HOW TO USE**
1. Open Window -> AnimationSpriteSwapper.
2. Specify the animation in which you want to replace the sprites.
3. Select any sprite from the sprite directory of the current animation and place it in the Old path cell.
4. Select any sprite from the sprite directory of the new animation and place it in the New path cell.
5. Click the "Swap" button.

Each sprite from the first directory used in the animation will be replaced by the corresponding sprite from the second directory.

For example, we have two directories:

**Animation1**
- a1_sprite_1
- a1_sprite_2
- a1_sprite_3

**Animation2**
- a2_sprite_1
- a2_sprite_2
- a2_sprite_3

Put **a1_sprite_1** in the Old path and **a2_sprite_1** in the New path. Sprites are replaced as follows:

a1_sprite_1 -> a2_sprite_1

a1_sprite_2 -> a2_sprite_2

a1_sprite_3 -> a2_sprite_3
